### Creating a GitHub repository for the first time

Hi there,

Just an old school programmer and sysadmin trying to catch up with the new techologies.

I wonder if someone will EVER read this :). Either way, it doesn't matter ;) Let's just mess around with the Markdown a little bit.

```
Code snippet
```

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

A [link](google.com)

And finally, a bullet list:
- 1
- 2
- 3

Cheers,
Moka
