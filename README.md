### Creating a GitHub repository for the first time

Hi there,

I'm just an old school programmer and sysadmin trying to catch up with the new techologies.

I wonder if someone will EVER read this... But it doesn't really matter ;)

Let's just mess around with the Markdown a little bit:

```
Code snippet with backticks
```

    And another one with the 4-spaces syntax,
    and multiple lines...

```javascript
// This one uses the backticks again, and JavaScript syntax highlight
// Mind that this Highlight stuff does not work with the 4-spaces syntax
if(true){
  return true;
}
```

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

A [link](http://www.google.com)

A numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

An ordered numbered list, with a sub-list:
1. First
2. Second
   1. First of the Second
   2. Second of the Second
3. Third

An unordered bullet list, with a sub-list, using the asterisk (star) syntax:

* A
* B
* C
   * C-1
   * C-2
* D

### References

Writing this was fun, but there's a lot more to learn about MarkDown. Here are some nice references I've found in my researches:

* Definitions and history in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Adam Pritchard's Markdown [CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* "Everything you need to learn" about [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

Have Fun!
